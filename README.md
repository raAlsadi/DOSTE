	•	Provide accurate and adaptable answers to a wide range of tourist inquiries.
	•	Enhance cultural relevance in responses in both Arabic and English.
	•	Leverage transfer learning, selective layer freezing, and transformer architecture to improve model performance.
	•	Optionally generate images to support user experience.

Key Features
	•	The first chatbot trained on specialized tourism data for Saudi Arabia.

Why DOSTE?

Traditional question-answering systems struggle with rigidity and lack of adaptability to the diverse and context-sensitive nature of tourist questions. DOSTE offers a smart and flexible alternative by generating responses directly using custom training that enhances content accuracy and relevance.

Model Architecture
	•	Base Model: GPT-NEO (125 million parameters)
	•	Training Techniques: Transfer learning, selective layer freezing
	•	Data Domain: Information on tourism in Saudi Arabia (landmarks, events, culture, etc.)

Image Generation (Optional)

To enhance user engagement, the system can generate relevant images on request using key elements extracted from the user’s query or the generated text.
